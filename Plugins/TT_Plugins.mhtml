<h3><a name=3D"Starter"></a>Plugin Starter (Mac OS, Windows)</h3>

<blockquote>If you want to write your own plugins, you may use this
   skeleton. It requires CodeWarrior Pro 4 or higher. It supports
   68K, PowerPC, Carbon and Windows x86 code generation.
  =20
   <p>Updates:
  =20
   </p><ul>
      <li>Jan 18, 2000: Verified that RB 2.1a25 has fixed the bug
      that prevented x86 plugins from working in Windows builds.</li>
     =20
      <li>Jan 28, 2000: Now calls init code for static C++ objects
      and globals.</li>
     =20
      <li>Feb 6, 2000: Does not require "MPW C calling convention"
      enabled globally any more; added more samples for handling
      Boolean and Double types; easened the update to CW Pro 5.</li>
     =20
      <li>Jan 22, 2001: Added support for Carbon output, proper C++
      object initialization and destruction, x-platform cleanup code
      and an Event Handler example. Removed support for CW Pro 2 -
      Pro 4 is minimum now.</li>

   stored in a Collection object, similar to the available "Item"
   method that returned the values from a Collection.
  =20
   <p>The plugin works with Mac OS (68K, PPC) and Windows (x86).

<h3><a name=3D"BitOps"></a>Bit Ops (Mac OS, Windows)</h3>

<blockquote>This plugin adds methods for many useful bitwise
   operations on Integers.
  =20
   <p>It also provides a new class <b>TTsBitSet</b> that handles
   large arrays of bits.
  =20
   </p><p>Here's an incomplete list of the provided functions: And, Or,
   XOr, Not, Nor, Nand, Shift, Rotate, Clone, Copy, Compare, Find.
  =20
   </p><p>The plugin should work under Mac OS (68K, PPC) as well as under
   Windows (x86).

<h3><a name=3D"EventMonitor"></a>TTsEventMonitor Class (Mac OS only)</h3>

<blockquote>This plugin lets you monitor events that your app
   receives, like key presses, mouse clicks and idle events. You can
   even modify or filter those events entirely.
  =20
   <p>For example, you can detect <b>Function Keys</b> because their
   <b>Keycode</b> is available to you via this plugin now. You can
   also detect and Key presses in conjunction with the <b>Command
   Key</b> before RB processes them any further, allowing you to
   support Cmd-Cursor combinations and others that are not included
   as menu bar shorcuts.
  =20

   events the plugin receives.

<h3><a name=3D"MacAliasRecord"></a>MacAliasRecord Class (Mac OS
only)</h3>

<blockquote>Do you need to save the location of a <b>FolderItem</b>
   in your <b>Preferences</b> file and retrieve that item later again
   when your app is relaunched?
  =20
   <p>Do you currently solve this by saving the <b>AbsolutePath</b>
   property of the FolderItem?
  =20
   </p><p>Here's why you want to use this class for this task:
  =20
   </p><p>If the user moves or renames the item, the saved absolute path
   will not be valid any more, and the item would be lost. However,
   using the MacAliasRecord to save and retrieve a FolderItem
   location, you will most likely be able keep the reference to the
   item, similar to a Alias file that you can create in the Finder.
   As a bonus, you can even locate items on removable and to network
   volumes, providing the user with the login dialog to the server.

<h3><a name=3D"SortInterface"></a>Array &amp; ListBox Sorting</h3>

<blockquote>A class that implements <b>QuickSort</b> and
   <b>BubbleSort</b>. It can sort any type of data: You need to
   subclass this class and then implement a Compare and a Swap
   function. The Sort class does the rest for you. It comes with
   lightly documented source and demonstration code.
  =20
   <p>There are two versions with slightly different ways of how to
   use the class:</p></blockquote>

tempel.org/ftp/pub/REALbasic/Array_ListBox_Sorting_RB2.sit">This
   advanced version</a> (20 KB) requires <b>RB version 2</b> and uses
   a new feature of RB2: a <i>Class Interface</i>.
  =20
   <p><b><i>Updated Apr 8, 99</i></b>:
  =20
   </p><ul>
      <li>Shows how to <b>override</b> the <b>default sorting</b> of
      <b>ListBox</b> columns</li>
     =20
      <li><b>Faster</b> ListBox sorting by using a smart "caching"
      mechanism.</li>
     =20
      <li>Contains another alternative Class Interface, where the
      sorted items are objects that have a <i>order/value</i>
      property.</li>
     =20
      <li>Comes now with three sample projects (two complex, one
      simple for easy inclusion in your projects).</li>

   older version</a> (13 KB) can be opened in all REALbasic versions

   <p>Updated Feb 26, 99: Doesn't reshuffle lines with equal contents
   any more.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name=3D"CatSearch"></a>Searching for certain files on a Mac OS
volume</h3>

<blockquote>This plugin implements the <b>PBCatSearch</b> function of
   the Mac OS File Manager. This is a very fast routine to find
   specific types of files on a volume. The MacOS tool
   <b>Sherlock</b> (aka <b>Find File</b>) uses this function to do
   its quick search on volumes.
  =20
   <p>This plugin also shows how you can allow your RB app to access
   complex data structures inside the plugin without having to create
   a REALbasic Control or Class, something that is not yet possible
   for Windows plugins (the trick is that you create a temporary
   structure inside the plugin and then provide accessor functions to
   get and set the individual elements of that structure).
  =20
   </p><p>Current Version: 2.1 (April 22, 2000)
  =20
   </p><p>New in 2.1 (since 2.0.1):
  =20
   </p><ul>
      <li>Updated for REALbasic v2.1 (attention: does not work
      properly with older versions as a 68K plugin any more!)</li>
     =20
      <li>Updated some documentation (Set... methods).</li>
   </ul>

<h3><a name=3D"FileMgr"></a>Mac OS File Manager support</h3>

<blockquote>This plugin gives you access to some functions of the Mac
   OS File Manager, such as relating RB's FolderItems to a <b>Volume
   Reference Number</b> (VRefNum), checking for Server volumes,
   getting &amp; setting more information about files (<b>File Flags
   and Attributes</b>) and getting, creating and resolving
   <b>FileIDs</b> &amp; <b>DirIDs</b>.
  =20
   <p>One of the functions is particularly helpful: RB 2.0 (and
   before) crashes when you open and then again close the <b>resource
   fork</b> of a file that was already opened by you or by the RB
   IDE. To prevent that, you can use <b>IsResourceForkOpen</b> before
   you open the resource fork and then do open it (and tell the user
   that you can't do it).
  =20
   </p><p><b><i>Updated July 4, 99 to version 1.2:</i></b>
  =20
   </p><ul>
      <li>Added two routines to create a FolderItem from Mac OS
      file/folder specs (NewFolderItemFromFSSpec).</li>
   </ul>

<h3><a name=3D"HideMenubar"></a>Hiding the Menu Bar and the Control Strip
Bar (Mac OS only)</h3>

<blockquote>This plugin allows you to hide the <b>Menu Bar</b> and
   anything else that would obscure the screen if you wanted to draw
   on the full screen, like the <b>rounded</b> <b>corners</b>, the
   <b>Application Switcher</b> floating window and the <b>Control
   Strip</b> bar.
  =20
   <p>Additionally, you can show and hide the <b>Control Strip</b>
   bar individually.
  =20
   </p><p>Two other valuable features of this plugin are:
  =20
   </p><ul>
      <li>Automatically restores the menu bar when the application is
      brought to the background or when the application quits
      unexpectedly (due to a crash).</li>
     =20
      <li>It is <b>Mac OS 8.5-savvy</b>, which means that it uses the
      new Mac OS 8.5's Menu Manager functions for hiding the menu
      bar, as suggested by Apple in the 8.5's Technote #1142.</li>
   </ul>
  =20
   <p>Current Version: 1.1.1 (June 1, 99). Features:
  =20
   </p><blockquote><ul>
         <li>Now includes the (previously missing) files from
         <b>HideMenubarEtc</b>.</li>
        =20
         <li>updated for REALbasic Version 2</li>
        =20
         <li>fixed a crashing bug with OS 8.5, another one with built
         apps</li>
        =20
         <li>now you can have a plain background that covers the
         whole screen, hiding all windows and icons of other
         applications.</li>
      </ul>

<h3><a name=3D"Gestalt"></a>Gestalt Manager support (Mac OS only)</h3>

<blockquote>Gestalt codes in MacOS are global settings, similar to
   environment variables in Unix and DOS.
  =20
   <p>Many applications and system extensions install a so-called
   Gestalt Selector that give other apps and the user some
   information about their state.
  =20
   </p><p>As an example, Mac OS always installs a Gestalt Selector with
   code "sysv", which returns the currently running system version.
  =20
   </p><p>Current Version: 1.0 (March 8, 99)
  =20
   </p><p>Note: This plugin becomes obsolete in RB 2.0.1, which offers a
   built-in function for this task ("System.Gestalt").

<h3><a name=3D"MacsBug"></a>Entering Low-Level debuggers like MacsBug
(Mac OS only)</h3>

<blockquote>Do you know what MacsBug is? If not, forget about this
   plugin or read about it on the <a href=3D"http://developer.apple.com/too=
ls/debuggers/MacsBug/index.html">MacsBug
   page</a> at Apple.
  =20
   <p>If you have MacsBug installed, this plugin lets you enter
   MacsBug by the debugger traps <b>Debugger()</b> and
   <b>DebugStr()</b>. This can come handy if you need to track down
   some low-level stuff within your RB app, like tracing the order of
   events.
  =20
   </p><p><b>Note:</b> You only need this plugin for RB version 1.
   Version 2 (actually v2.0.2) gives you a better way to call the
   Debugger by using the following declaration inside your methods:
  =20
   </p><blockquote><pre>Declare Sub Debugger Lib "InterfaceLib" Inline68K("=
A9FF")
Declare Sub DebugStr Lib "InterfaceLib" (msg as PString) Inline68K("ABFF")
      </pre></blockquote>
