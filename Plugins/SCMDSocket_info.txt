SimpleCMD_Socket 0.3

SimpleCMD_Socket is a socket class to easily implement sockets that can exchange arbitrary commands
with as many arguments as you want. It relies on a little command class called Socket_Command. As you
see from the version number, I've just written it in one day and there's not much documentation for it yet.

1. Installation

Drop the SimpleCMD_Socket and the Socket_Command classes onto your project window in Realbasic.

2. Usage

To send a command with a SimpleCMD_Socket, you first have to create a new instance of the Socket_Command class. On creation, it takes a number between 0-65335 (?) as argument: this is your  command token. In the following examples I'll use integer constants and not any number itself, because it's better.

Calling a remote host and listening is like with ordinary sockets, so I assume that you are already connected with a remote host now. To send a command, do the following:

Dim c as Socket_Command

c = new Socket_Command( CHAT ) // CHAT be an integer constant, say 1

c.append "Hello World!" // the command now has one argument 
c.append "How are you?" // another argument

SimpleCMD_Socket1.send c // now send the command

The other host will receive the command in the, guess where, in the

Receive(command as Socket_Command)

event.

To query the contents of a received command, use the following methods/properties:

command.command // contains the command token as integer

command.NthArgument(index as Integer) as String

retrieve the nth argument, "" if not there

command.ListCount() as Integer

returns the number of arguments available.

Arguments are always strings and may be of arbitrary length limited only by memory. Please note that this class isn't designed to transmit very large amounts of data--- I'll write another class for that soon :-)

Have fun!
