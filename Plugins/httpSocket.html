<H1>httpSocket 2.0</H1>
<P>&#160;&#160;httpSocket provides a simple, effective, and easy way to use the http
protocol through Realbasic. For example, with httpsocket, fetching the <A HREF="http://www.realsoftware.com/release.html">RB
Purchase Page</A> would be as simple as typing</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;<TT>httpSocket.GetFile &quot;www.realsoftware.com/purchase.html&quot;</TT></P>

<P>&#160;&#160;It also makes it easy to download files, and get info on the transfer,
such as the amount transfered, the percent transfered, and the speed of the transfer.</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;When a transfer is completed, httpSocket gives the data it has retrieved
in extremely useful formats. If you told it to download the file, it will give you
a folderitem of the destination. If you told it to get the file, it will return the
contents of the file. And, best of all, if the file it retrieved was a picture, httpSocket
gives it to you in a picture object!</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;And if that weren't enough, it goes the extra mile by including support
for proxies and referers. You can also use simple methods to set the name of your
client in HTTP/1.1 format, get relative URLs (such as ../../../mypage.html). You
can even post forms using both GET and POST.</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;And hey, if you're interested in password protected sites, look no
further! httpSocket now supports authentication. And now it supports resumable downloads
too!</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;So, what are you waiting for? Get httpSocket now!<BR>
