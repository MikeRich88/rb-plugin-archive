lass it and set the subclass' super (in the properties window) to SSLSocket=
. To do this, go to New Class from the File menu. Then select the class and=
 set its super to SSLSocket. Then drag a regular socket to your window or w=
hatever, and set its super to the class you just created. Hope this makes s=
ense.</font></p>

		<p><font face=3D"Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To use SSL=

SSLWrite button is pressed. Currently there is an HTTP GET command which re=

ew things nicely, so you should probably use it in your own projects. First=
 of all, it includes an SSLReadAll function which reads all incoming data a=
nd returns it as a string. Second of all, it handles the initial SSL connec=
tion by repeatedly calling SSLContinueConnect until it has connected, and t=
hen passing the incoming data to its instances. Third, it adds a WeakSeed f=
unction with seeds SSLSocket with a weakly random key, based on REALbasic's=
 pseudo-random number generator. I would recommend looking at its code to u=
